    "The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) conducts mosquito spraying as part of their measure to reduce the occurrence of WNV. The spraying is conducted from dusk to around midnight from ultra low volumn (ULV) sprayer trucks, using the chemical Zenivexâ„¢ E4 (City of Chicago, 2019). This is a 4% solution of etofenprox, sprayed at 4.5 - 9 ounces per minute, at a vehicle speed of 10 - 15 mph (Central Massachussettes Mosquito Control Project). Assuming each truck has an area of effect of about 3 m to each side of the truck, the overall spray area is approximately 0.6 km2 per truck.\n",
    "The cost of Zenivex E4 is about \\$80 USD per gallon ([North Dakota Department of Health, 2013](http://www.gfmosquito.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-North-Dakota-Bid-Tabulation.pdf)). Given the current rate of spraying and assuming a total spray duration of 5 hours, the cost of pesticides for <i>each sprayer truck</i> is **\\\\$1439.00**.\n",

    "During our external research, we have uncovered serveral recommendations for our agency and the concerned public to consider:\n",
    "* **Adult Control**\n",
    "    * Spray efforts should be concentrated during the months of August, at traps where there is a high risk of ENV present, and also considering weather data when the relative humidity and wind speeds are significant. We should then continue to measure mosquito population size and infection rates before and after spraying to monitor the efficacy of the treatments.\n",
    "* **Larval Control**\n",
    "    * To reduce mosquito breeding by eliminating stagnant water, city agency should treat all catch basins with larvicide during the month of June-July (before the adult mosquitoes hatch), to limit mosquito breeding and reduce the adult mosquito density.\n",
    "* **Public Education**\n",
    "    * To effectively target areas where there is a density of human residents, we will need to educate the public on active measures they can take to eradicate musquitos within their residencies, and having self protection. For such a scale, we should involve the health agency to spread awareness, drive campaigns and educate the public on actions that inidividuals can take. Personal protection measures can also be subsidised by the government in giving out insect repellent and performing checks around their homes to clear mosquito breeding grounds\n",
    "* **Bird Surveillance**\n",
    "    * During our reasearch, we found that dead birds found in the city were tested for WNV and found to be positive. This is significant, as the mosquitoes likely are infected with WNV from feeding from these birds, allowing us to be a step ahead. We should collate this data as an additional feature to further improve our model."
