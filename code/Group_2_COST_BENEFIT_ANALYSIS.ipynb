    "The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) conducts mosquito spraying as part of their measure to reduce the occurrence of WNV. The spraying is conducted from dusk to around midnight from ultra low volumn (ULV) sprayer trucks, using the chemical Zenivex™ E4 (City of Chicago, 2019). This is a 4% solution of etofenprox, sprayed at 4.5 - 9 ounces per minute, at a vehicle speed of 10 - 15 mph (Central Massachussettes Mosquito Control Project). Assuming each truck has an area of effect of about 3 m to each side of the truck, the overall spray area is approximately 0.6 km2 per truck.\n",
    "The cost of Zenivex E4 is about \\$80 USD per gallon ([North Dakota Department of Health, 2013](http://www.gfmosquito.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-North-Dakota-Bid-Tabulation.pdf)). Given the current rate of spraying and assuming a total spray duration of 5 hours, the cost of pesticides for <i>each sprayer truck</i> is <b>\\\\$843.76 - \\$1687.50 USD</b>.\n",
    "Given that the total area of Chicago is 606.1 km2, it would take about 1000 trucks at the same time to cover the entire area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is continuing its efforts to combat against the West Nile virus, even in 2020. The insecticide used by the CDPH is the Zenivex E4. Zenivex™, is approved for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and has been widely applied to control mosquitoes in outdoor residential and recreational areas."
